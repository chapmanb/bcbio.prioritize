## 0.0.4 (20 November 2015)

- Skip reporting of large structural variants with no evidence in breakends.

## 0.0.3 (19 November 2015)

- For large structural variant events (> 50kb) only report genes intersecting
  with end points. Enables more useful annotation for long range events like
  gene fusions.
- Enable build 38 coordinates for preparing known gene BED file from CIViC.

## 0.0.2 (19 October 2015)

- Enable known prioritization with a pre-prepared BED file.
