# bcbio.prioritize

Prioritize small variants, structural variants and coverage based on biological
inputs. The goal is to use pre-existing knowledge of relevant genes, domains and
pathways involved with a disease to extract the most interesting signal from a
set of high quality small or structural variant calls. Given information on
coverage, it will be able to identify poorly covered regions in potential genes
of interest.

This is currently exploratory work in progress.
